# Azure Infrastructure Solutioning


CloudTech has decided to invest into building net-new Microsoft Azure practices based upon the guidance from their PDM and PTS.  The first practice will focus on lift and shift solutions that drive Azure consumption within the compute, network, and storage workloads.  The next practice will focus on High Availability and Disaster Recovery solutions leveraging workloads such as Azure Site Recovery and Azure backup.  CloudTech also wants to have capacity and capability to pursue application development opportunities in Microsoft Azure as well as running open source workloads on Azure.  These are the key investments for CloudTech.

For the past several months you have worked with CloudTech to build their capacity and capability to deliver these solutions.  After a recent marketing campaign, the sales teams have landed a qualified opportunity at Contoso and have secured funding to provide a Proof of Concept.  You’ve been asked to assist CloudTech in delivering this engagement.  CloudTech resources will observe you delivering this engagement and use it as a model for a repeatable solution moving forward.

Discovery meetings via Skype have taken place with CloudTech and Contoso and you have identified the following opportunities:

## Website
 - Contoso wants to establish an ecommerce website for an upcoming product launch.  You’ve learned this website requires a legacy MSI application and Contoso needs to maintain direct control of the web server.  
 - Contoso is concerned about downtime given the potential revenue this new web application will generate.  The CTO has stated that the web application must continue to service consumers yet not be too expensive to operate.  For context, he referenced the [AWS outage](https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/) from earlier this year as a specific situation he wants to avoid.

## Virtual Servers
 - Contoso has several virtual servers that house applications essential to running the business.
 - A recent outage in their datacenter caused these servers to be unavailable for several hours.  Data was lost and the economic impact to the company was measurable.
 - Contoso has no line item in their budget this FY to upgrade the core infrastructure of the aging datacenter.
 - After talking to the CTO, these VMs must be back online in no more than two hours and experience no more than one hour of lost data.

Your next meeting with the customer and partner is to white board the conceptual architecture of these solutions and present a high-level cost estimate using the Pricing Calculator (You can use either the [Channel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/channel/) calculator that requires a login or the [Public](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) calculator that doesn't).  If the customer is agreeable with the results, your next course of action will be to build out the complete Proof of Concept.
